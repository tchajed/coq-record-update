synopsis: "Generic support for updating record fields in Coq"
description: """
While Coq provides projections for each field of a record, it has no
convenient way to update a single field of a record. This library provides a
generic way to update a field by name, where the user only has to implement a
simple typeclass that lists out the record fields."""
